# A dataset of Snow-road

The images in this dataset are of actual road scenes captured while unmanned vehicle driving.

If this dataset is provided for research purposes, please see License section below.


## Files
Currently the dataset contains 6000 infrared images, visible light images and ground-truth depth maps.

```
-----------------------------------------------------
infrared images         | 6000 | 7.40M tokens
visible light images    | 6000 |  396K tokens
ground-truth depth maps | 6000 | 1.11M tokens
-----------------------------------------------------
```

## Format
The raw images in Snow-road dataset are the resolution of 768×576.
We crop the infrared images, visible light images and depth maps to the resolution of 256×512 for depth estimation. Next, training and testing labels are generated by classifying the depth map into 32 levels in the logarithmic space
